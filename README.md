node_modules  :  It's like a database all the dependencies have it's own code Example we are having the parcel now inside the node_modules there are so many files why there because the parcel have it's own dependencies that's why so many files are there this is known as transitive dependencies 

we also wants to add the node_modules inside the gitignore file because it's a huge file we shouldn't add the package and package.lock.json inside the gitignore because we can recreate the node_modules using the npm install
